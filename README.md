# XmlBookProject

## Description

**XmlBookProject** is a tool for converting text files into formatted XML files. It also provides features to extract specific chapters from an XML file, generate XML statistics, and validate the XML against a schema (XSD). The tool allows for the creation of a second XML file, where chapters are randomly selected, with the option to validate the XML using a corresponding XSD file.

## Features

- Convert text files into unformatted XML files.
- Transform unformatted XML into formatted XML.
- Generate an XML file containing only selected or randomly created chapters from a source XML.
- Add statistics (total chapters, paragraphs, words, unique words) to the XML file.
- Automatically record creation date and author information.
- **Dynamic Methods:** Many methods in the project are dynamic, meaning they accept parameters like file paths and other options to customize the behavior.
- Generate an XSD schema for XML structure validation.
- Validate the XML against the generated XSD to ensure the file structure is correct.
